# Augmented-Random-Search-Implementation



This repository contains implementation of Augmenetd Random Search which was a paper published in 2018, and is a very recent cutting edge technology developed in the field of Reinforcement Learning. In this, I have trained an AI to learn and adapt to an environment and walk in a fully artificially intelligent environment. And the beauty of the algorithm is doesn't contain any deep neural architectures and hidden layers, but only an input and an output layer, and the AI learns to walk in the environment.
